# TopoTool: Topographic Analysis Tool

This project is a Python-based Jupyter notebook for instant topographic analysis using global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. It helps users analyze slope, flow accumulation, and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) for any location, and overlays building footprints to support decisions on stormwater retention and drainage.

## Features
- Instantly access 30-meter SRTM DEM data for any location
- Calculate slope, flow accumulation, and TWI
- Overlay building footprint data
- Identify potential stormwater retention sites

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TopoTool.git
cd TopoTool
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch Jupyter Notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```
Open `Copy of Topography_v2_Global_updated05.28.2024.ipynb` and run the cells in order.

## Usage Notes
- If analyzing a new location, follow the notebook's instructions to clear previous outputs.
- If you encounter missing packages, install them with `pip install packagename`.

# Global Topography Analysis (Updated May 28, 2024)

This Jupyter Notebook (`Topography_v2_Global.ipynb`) provides a data-driven analysis and visualization of global topography using geospatial datasets. It leverages Python's geospatial and visualization libraries to explore, process, and present elevation data at a global scale.

---

##  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Load and process global elevation (topography) datasets.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on topographic data.
- Generate insightful visualizations including maps, histograms, and elevation distribution plots.
- Enable scalable, reproducible geospatial analysis using open-source Python tools.

---

##  Tools & Libraries Used

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `geopandas`
- `rasterio`
- `xarray`
- `cartopy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib.pyplot`

---

## Key Features

- Load and read global raster datasets (e.g., DEM data).
- Reproject and clip raster layers to match global boundaries.
- Visualize elevation with color maps and overlays.
- Compute summary statistics on elevation values.
- Handle large-scale geospatial datasets efficiently.

---

## Example Visualizations

- Global topography maps using custom colormaps
- Elevation histograms and distribution plots
- Comparative views of elevation across regions

---

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib geopandas rasterio xarray cartopy seaborn
