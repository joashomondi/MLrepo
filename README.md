# TopoTool: Topographic Analysis Tool

This project is a Python-based Jupyter notebook for instant topographic analysis using global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. It helps users analyze slope, flow accumulation, and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) for any location, and overlays building footprints to support decisions on stormwater retention and drainage.

## Features
- Instantly access 30-meter SRTM DEM data for any location
- Calculate slope, flow accumulation, and TWI
- Overlay building footprint data
- Identify potential stormwater retention sites

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TopoTool.git
cd TopoTool
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch Jupyter Notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```
Open `Copy of Topography_v2_Global_updated05.28.2024.ipynb` and run the cells in order.

## Usage Notes
- If analyzing a new location, follow the notebook's instructions to clear previous outputs.
- If you encounter missing packages, install them with `pip install packagename`.
